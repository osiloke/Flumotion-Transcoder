Bugs:
- The pre-processing should be made safe by copying the input file (#1058)

Documentation:
- Complete the README
- Update (write from scratch?) the documentation

Features:
- Add the result of the "file" command in the report (#797)
- Add the file header (hexdump) in the report (#797)
- Make the file monitor build a configuration for each file 
  with htaccess-like files (#882)
- Add multi-pass encoding support (#783)
- Add a size/duration limitation for the output targets (#798)
- Add an option to force the group and rights of the generated files (#1060)
- Compare the duration of the source file and target file if possible (#1061)
- Change the scheduler to use a faire queuing algorithm (#1063)
- Add input file filtering (#1065)
- Add input file rejection (#1066)
- Create an SQL datasource (#1068)
- Create an API for customer/profile/targets modification at runtime (#1069)
- Categorize transcoding errors (#1078)
- Monitor symlinks and reproduce the symlinks for the outgoing files (#1079)
- Write temporary reports in a different directory (#1081)
- Add socket to the file-transcoder to be able to plug processing steps (#1130)
- Make each transcoding log in separate files to be able to add it 
  in the error report
- Add a parameter to acknowledge to say if and where the source file 
  should be moved to be able to make inplace transcoding 
  (without moving the sourcefile).
- Add configuration/report files versioning and automatique upgrading.
- Add authentication token to the datasource/datastore/API to be able to
  manage rights and log who made odifications (#1271)
- Add a transcoding-command component that listen somehow (HTTP GET?) and
  send trancoding request to the admin like the file-monitor (#1272)
- Add a configuration override parameter to the transcoding-command and
  file-monitor components to be able in one case add command parameters
  and in the other have .htaccess like overriding files (#1273)

Tests:
- Write manual test procedures (like for FSP)
- More test suites, more test suites, more test suites.

Refactoring:
- Change file-transcoder to use substitution.py class
- Remove multi-interface support for event sources, it's not used
  and make the event handling more complicated
- Change the event source to not have to be able to add an object 
  implementing only a base interface.
  Ex: The admin should be able to only implement IComponentListener
      and register as listnener of a ComponentSet without implementing
      all component interfaces (ITranscoderListener and IMonitorListener)
- Refactor file transcoder contexts to match the admin standard 
  for fileFile, fileDir, fileBase, filePath, fileRelPath, 
  profileName, customerName, targetName.
- Workout a solution to remove the deep references in contexts and stores.
- Better retry count handling for task's components to make the diffrence
  between actively stopped components and crashed components.
