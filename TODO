- I had this traceback:
LOG   [10967]                                  transcoder        Oct 16 20:57:59      ERROR in task fluendo with filename /home/file/fluendo/incoming/hellofluendo.3gp : Got a timeout while trying to transcode '/home/file/fluendo/incoming/hellofluendo.3gp' (flumotion/transcoder/transcoder.py:354)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/usr/lib/flumotion/python/flumotion/transcoder/watcher.py", line 75, in _timeoutCb
    if (newf in oldfiles) and newsize == self._files[newf]:
KeyError: '/var/tmp/flumotion/transcoder/fluendo/hellofluendo.full.ogg'

when starting up the transcoder with a file in incoming already that was
not in outgoing
UPDATE: According to the code, it's (close to) impossible that this state ever
happens. But added an extra test before in watcher.py.

- I can't transcode hellofluendo.3gp on the installed cluster; it times out
  after connecting two pads

UPDATE: seems fixed with cvs version of oggmuxer
UPDATE: But latest cvs of oggmux breaks that for other files (doesn't emit EOS
	even though all sinkpads have received an EOS).

- make sure log level 3 is human-readable and gives the sysadmin
  exactly what he needs
  THIS IS IMPORTANT ! AT LOG LEVEL 3, YOU SHOULD SEE FOR EACH FILE IF IT
  MANAGED TO TRANSCODE, OR FAILED, and give a clear but short indication of
  *WHY* it failed
  All these services normally run at level 3!!!

- Have the actual transcoding task in a separate process so that segfaults in
  plugins don't result in having the whole daemon go down.
- make sure it handles every possible error correctly so it never locks up
- make sure it works for MPEG
- make sure it can handle every file in gst/media
- document
- rename task to something less confusing
- get rid of GStreamer warnings
- move incoming files to an error dir so that customer knows a file couldn't
  transcode
- delete 0-length files created by filesink if the encoding bins could not link
- don't transcode directories (which happens in bad configs that overlap)
