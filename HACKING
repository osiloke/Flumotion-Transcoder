HACKING NOTES
-------------
- problem: gst.Discoverer discovers the "real" video size of theora files
  (ie with cropping applied), but cortado ignores cropping, so using
  the real size makes the iframe too small


- objects:
  - profile:
    - contains the configuration for one encoding profile
    - should not have any specifics about files

  - transcoder:
    - takes one input file and a config of one or more encoding profiles
    - allows you to write a simple script that transcodes a file immediately,
      not with delays
    - written in such a way that it can be moved to GStreamer
      (GObject, ...)
    - interface:
      - __init__(inputFile)
      - addOutput(outputFile, profile)
      - start()
      - signals for reporting

  - directory watcher:
    - responsible for receiving incoming files, putting them on a queue, and
      creating transcoder objects per file
    - can possibly fork off the transcoder job
    - can possibly look at cpu usage of transcoder job and have an inactivity
      timeout so it can give up on a file
    - at the end of transcoding, it moves the output files to their final
      destination, and can generate cortado links
    - glue between main transcode program and the transcoder object
