== Public Features Overview ==

=== Distributed Transcoding ===

The transcoding jobs are automatically distributed amongst a set of servers.
If any server was disconnected for a certain amount of time or crashed, the jobs
would be automatically restarted on another server.
Another big advantage is the scalability of the platform,
if more transcoding power is needed, just add a server and the platform
will be able to process more media files.

=== Prioritized Transcoding ===

There is two different kind of priority management:
 * '''Transcoding Queue Priority:'''[[br]]
 The transcoding queue priority define the order in witch the transcoding job are started.
 When a transcoder task can be started, the profiles with higher transcoding queue priority
 will be chosen first. This could be used to create a set of profiles with different priority
 and choose when dropping a file the relative order of transcodification.
 Each transcoding profile has its own transcoding priority value.

 * '''Transcoding Task Priority:'''[[br]]
 This define the priority of transcoding task to use server CPU resources.
 When two transcoding tasks are running at the same time on a server,
 the one with higher task priority will have a bigger share of CPU time
 meaning that it will run and terminate faster. This could be used
 for testing profiles, to prevent a transcoding test to slow down
 production transcoding.
 Each transcoding profile has its own transcoding priority value.


=== Integrated Thumbnailing ===

The thumbnail generation is integrated inside the transcoding process,
it's not an external postprocessing. It means that if a file can be
transcoded the thumbnails extraction is guaranteed, and that the full
quality of the source media file will be used for the thumbnail creation.

=== Video Dimensions Control ===

There is various options to specify the dimensions of the output files:

 * '''Without Specification:'''[[br]]
 When only the output pixel aspect ratio is specified, the transcoder
 will deduce the output dimension respecting the source display aspect ratio.
 The profile can be configured to preserve the input video height or width,
 or prefer to upscale or downscale the input video.

 * '''Partial Specification:'''[[br]]
 Only one of the dimension is specified. The other one is deduced by
 the transcoder in respect to the source dimensions and pixel aspect ratio.

 * '''Complete Specification:'''[[br]]
 The width and height can be specified directly. If the source dimensions
 and pixel aspect ratio is not compatible with the specified dimensions,
 black bands will be added on top and bottom or left and right to respect
 the specified dimensions without deforming the source video.

In addition, there is options to control the deduced dimensions:
 * '''Maximum Dimensions:'''[[br]]
 The maximum width and height of the output video can be specified.
 In allow at the same time to not upscale low resolution video
 by not specifying static dimensions, but control the maximum
 dimensions to prevent very high resolution videos.

=== Thumbnail Dimensions Control ===

In the same way as for the video targets, the thumbnails dimensions
can be specified partially or completely adding black bands to
respect the display aspect ratio of the source video.

=== Frame Sampling ===

More than one thumbnail can be extracted from an input video
by specifying an period value, an period unit and the maximum
number of thumbnail to extrace.[[br]]
The period unit can be:
 * Video Frames
 * Seconds
 * Duration Percentage
For example, the profile can be setup to generate a maximum of
9 thumbnails each 10 percents of the input video. This would
sample 9 thumbnails evenly independently of the input video
duration.

=== Stateless Monitoring ===

The transcoder monitor a directory usualy named *incoming*.
When a file is drop in this directory, it schedule a transcoding job
for it. When the transcoding job terminate, the input file is moved
either to the *done* or *failed* directory.

This behavior make possible to transcode again a file regar
