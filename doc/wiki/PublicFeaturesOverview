== Public Features Overview ==

=== Distributed Transcoding ===

The transcoding jobs are automatically distributed amongst a set of servers.
If any server was disconnected for a certain amount of time or crashed, the jobs
would be automatically restarted on another server.
Another big advantage is the scalability of the platform,
if more transcoding power is needed, just add a server and the platform
will be able to process more media files.

=== Prioritized Transcoding ===

There is two different kind of priority management:
 * '''Transcoding Queue Priority'''.[[br]]
 The transcoding queue priority define the order in witch the transcoding job are started.
 When a transcoder task can be started, the profiles with higher transcoding queue priority
 will be chosen first. This could be used to create a set of profiles with different priority
 and choose when dropping a file the relative order of transcodification.
 Each transcoding profile has its own transcoding priority value.

 * '''Transcoding Task Priority'''.[[br]]
 This define the priority of transcoding task to use server CPU resources.
 When two transcoding tasks are running at the same time on a server,
 the one with higher task priority will have a bigger share of CPU time
 meaning that it will run and terminate faster. This could be used
 for testing profiles, to prevent a transcoding test to slow down
 production transcoding.
 Each transcoding profile has its own transcoding priority value.


=== Integrated Thumbnailing ===

The thumbnail generation is integrated inside the transcoding process,
it's not an external postprocessing. It means that if a file can be
transcoded the thumbnails extraction is guaranteed, and that the full
quality of the source media file will be used for the thumbnail creation.

=== Media Dimension Control ===

=== Frame Sampling ===

=== Stateless Monitoring ===

=== Subdirectory Replication ===

=== Multiple Notification ===

=== Notification Queue ===

=== Notification Customization ===

=== Target Postprocessing ===

=== Identity Target ===
