What
----

This is Fluendo's transcoder, a part of Flumotion Advanced.


How
---

Build an uninstalled transcoder:

First, Flumotion should be installed or the uninstalled environment
must be properly setup.

  To configure and build the transcoder:
  $ ./autogen.sh


Setting up an uninstalled environment:

If the transcoder is not installed on the admin and manager machine,
the environment should be setup to use an unstalled version.
This is done sourcing the script bin/transcoder-uninstalled-environment
with the version of the transcoder to use as parameter (default to trunk).
This script will look for the environment variable TRANSCODER_BASE
to know where are the diffrents versions of the transcoder,
if not defined, it will look for the environment variable WORKSPACE
and deduce TRANSCODER_BASE as "$WORKSPACE/flumotion/transcoder",
and if WORKSPACE is not define "$HOME/workspace/flumotion/transcoder"
will be used. The version specified as parameter of the script should be
a sub-directory of TRANSCODER_BASE, and if not specified trunk is assumed.
The prompt will be modified to remember the current environment.
THIS SCRIPT SHOULD BE SOURCED AND WILL NOT START A NEW SHELL.

  To use the uninstalled version in $TRANSCODER_BASE/trunk:
  $ . bin/transcoder-uninstalled-environment
  [TRANS] $
  
  To use the uninstalled version in $TRANSCODER_BASE/test:
  $ . bin/transcoder-uninstalled-environment test
  [TRANS test] $


Upgrading the transcoder configuration:

The script "bin/flumotion-transcoder-upgrade" can upgrade
the transcoder configuration to ensure it's compatible with 
the current version of the transcoder, and bootstrap the configuration
from an old transcoder configuration format.

	To upgrade (Not Implemented Yet):
	$ . bin/transcoder-uninstalled-environment
	[TRANS] $ bin/flumotion-transcoder-upgrade -vv upgrade \
	> -c conf/transcoder-admin.ini
	
	To bootstrap from an old configuration format:
	$ . bin/transcoder-uninstalled-environment
	[TRANS] $ bin/flumotion-transcoder-upgrade -vv bootstrap \
	> -o /etc/flumotion-tanscoder.ini -n /etc/flumotion/transcoder
	
The bootstrap command has more optional parameters to tweak the conversion process.


Transcoding Manager:

The transcoding manager should load the plug 'transcoder-environment'.
For an example of configuration see conf/managers/transcoder/planet.xml
The transcoder should be installed on the manager machine,
or an uninstalled environment should be setup (see before).

  To start a manager with debug logging:
  $ . bin/transcoder-uninstalled-environment
  [TRANS] $ flumotion-manager -d 4 -T tcp -H manager.dev -P 7632 \
  > -n transcoder conf/managers/transcoder/planet.xml


Transcoding Workers:

The transcoding workers are independent of the transcoding installation.
The transcoder do not have to be installed on the workers' machines,
and the uninstalled environment is not needed.
WORKERS MUST HAVE DIFFERENT NAMES.

  To start a worker with debug logging:
  $ flumotion-worker -d 4 -T tcp -H manager.dev -P 7632 -n worker1 \
  > -u user -p test


Transcoder Admin:

The transcoder admin machine need the transcoder to be installed,
or the uninstalled environment to be setup properly.
It need a configuration file (typically named transcoder-admin.ini).
For an example of configuration see conf/transcoder/transcoder-admin.ini
For more information about transcoder configuration,
see section 3 of doc/specification.odt
NOTE THAT THE CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO WORK.

  To start the transcoder admin with debug logging:
  $ . bin/transcoder-uninstalled-environment
  [TRANS] $ bin/flumotion-transcoder-admin -d 4 conf/transcoder/transcoder-admin.ini


Start as Daemons:

Following are the commands to start the differents process
of the transcoder as daemon. It's assumed the transcoder is installed.

	Start the manager as daemon:
	$ flumotion-manager -d 4 -D --daemonize-to=/ -L /var/log/flumotion \
	> -R /var/run/flumotion -T tcp -P 7632 -n transcoder conf/planet.xml
	
	Start the workers as daemon:
	$ flumotion-worker -d 4 -D --daemonize-to=/ -L /var/log/flumotion \
	> -R /var/run/flumotion -T tcp -H manager.dev -P 7632 -n worker1 \
	> -u user -p test

	Start the admin as daemon:
	$ flumotion-transcoder-admin -d 4 -D --daemonize-to=/ \
	> -L /var/log/flumotion	-R /var/run/flumotion conf/transcoder-admin.ini
