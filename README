What
----

This is Fluendo's transcoder, a part of Flumotion Advanced.


How
---

There is a transcoder daemon that watches a directory for incoming media
files. When a file is completely written to that directory[0], the
transcoder forks a job to perform transcoding.

The transcoding job first checks if GStreamer understands the input
file, using the python discoverer. Then it simultaneously transcodes the
input to all specified output formats. At the end it runs the discoverer
again on the output files. It can optionally notify a remote web site
when the output files are done using a HTTP GET request, passing details
about the output files.

[0] This condition is currently signalled if a file's size does not
change in a configurable period of time.
